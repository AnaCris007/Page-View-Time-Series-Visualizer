# 97.5% quantile. In order to do this we are using the method .quartile()
# that is used to return the value of that quantile. For example, the qauntile(0.025), means
# the value were 97.5% of the values in the dataframe are above that value, while
# 2.5% of the values in the dataframe are below that that value.

    # This works, but there is a problem: in this way the name of the x and y axis
    # are 'date' and 'value', not 'Date' and 'Page Views', and there is no title in the chart as the exercise required. 
    # In order to change the name of the axis I had to search more. I found this website:
    # https://www.statology.org/seaborn-axis-labels/
